## 2026-09-14 - [Insecure SSL Fallback]
**Vulnerability:** Downloader had a try-except block that fell back to `verify=False` for SSL requests when downloading files, exposing the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
**Learning:** Never disable SSL verification in HTTP clients, as this bypasses the security guarantees of HTTPS and can lead to silent interception or modification of downloaded files.
**Prevention:** Remove the insecure fallback block and enforce `verify=True` in all HTTP client requests. Use appropriate custom CA bundles if self-signed certificates are necessary in internal environments, instead of disabling verification completely.
